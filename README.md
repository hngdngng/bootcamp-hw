# Code Refactor to Optimize Site for Search Engines

## Problem
A marketing agency wants to optimize their website for search engines by making their codebase more aligned with accessibility standards.

## Success Criteria
The source code shall have the following:
* Semantic HTML elements
* Elements shall follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image elements shall have accessible alt attributes
* Heading attributes shall be in sequential order when viewed
* Title elemets shall be concise and descriptive

## Source Code Findings
* Client navigation bar link to "Search Engine Optimization" detailed section was broken/non-functional
* Images did not have alt attributes
* HTML5 semantic tags were not used in source code
* CSS selectors could be further consolodated to optimize code with shared properties and values
* CSS code flow was not sequential to order of elements on page
* Lacked comments for future developers to quickly understand the code

## Solution
Source code (html and css) were updated to address findings in order to meet success criteria. 

## Recommendations
Website could be further improved to be compatible with multiple window sizes when opened. This update will occur in a later stage of the project.
